Kodi Plugin - Player for the Samsung SE-208BW ProDVD server

What is this Kodi Plugin?<br />
The ProDVD player is a Kodi plugin that is created for the ProDVD server on the Samsung SE-208BW.
As the Network DVD drive is obsolete there is no real up to date method to play Movies over the network. This attempts to solve this.

So it is solely for the Samsung SE-208BW.<br />
It may work with other devices that run an instance of the ProDVD server, but a few modifications may be needed.

What is ProDVD?<br />
ProDVD (http://www.prodvd.net) is an old method to play DVD’s over UPNP.

I use this and it buffers and it freezes for a second after a while?<br />
Unfortunately, this works by creating a playlist of the .vob files and when it changes from one file to another, it will freeze for a second while it tries to run a new file. As far as I know Kodi does not offer a way to precache the next file.

This will not play [insert dvd name here] DVD?<br />
The ProDVD server is old and newer Movies (Especially Disney DVD’s) do not like to seem to play.
This seems to be due to the server, and not the plugin. If anybody can find a work around I would be gracious for the help
